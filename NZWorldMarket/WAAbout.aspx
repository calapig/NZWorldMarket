    <h3>Why another advertisement site??.</h3>
    <p>I have noticed that many people from overseas (and maybe locals as well) are creating their own small business and the way how they promote those are by the talk to talk of their customers or social networks like Facebook, that could not be the most effective way to reach new customers. On the other hand, this kind of business does not have a platform which let it manage orders of products or appointments of services, which usually are handled by text messages on the cell phone or messaging platforms like Whatsapp.
This scenario fits with the history of Martha and Julieth, both from Colombia. Martha has a small business of typical Colombian food by request, where the orders of her customers are handled by Whatsapp and she gets news customers through the recommendation of her old customers. Meanwhile, Julieth has her own business on treatments of beauty by request to your home (manicure and haircut). She offers her services to her contacts as well by Whatsapp and takes the appointments of her clients by a phone call. 
One online platform would let these two women show its specialized services easier, as well they will be able to get new customers 24 hours x 7 days a week (more effectiveness). Furthermore, the same platform could help them both to have an organized schedule on their jobs (increase their efficiency).
These are only 2 cases that I found, but it is for sure that can be hundreds more in Auckland and thousands in New Zealand. We must keep in count as well, casual people that publish in Facebook or/and other media, day by day, products in few quantities made in overseas to get some extra money.  In this case, the online platform makes less tedious (efficiency + effectiveness) to post daily advertisements for casual products of casual people.
The idea of NZworldmarket.co was born from the concept of night markets on Auckland combined with the online sites of deals on the internet, where you can go to a place and find little business of different cultures or casual services and products. You know you can go there and it is highly possible to find unique products, that belongs to your own/different culture/country offered by small businessmen’s.
